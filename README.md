A proof-of-origin token (POT) provider to be used alongside [coletdjnz's POT plugin framework](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-get-pot). We use [LuanRT's Botguard interfacing library](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils) to generate the token.

This is used to bypass the 'Sign in to confirm you're not a bot' message when invoking yt-dlp from an IP address flagged by YouTube. See _[What is a PO Token?](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#po-token-guide)_ for more details.

The provider comes in two parts:

1. **Provider**: Two options -
   - (a) An HTTP server that generates the POT, and has interfaces for the plugin to retrieve data from (easy setup + docker image provided)
   - (b) A POT generation script supplied via extractor arguments
2. **Provider plugin**: uses POT plugin framework to retrieve data from the provider, allowing yt-dlp to simulate having passed the 'bot check'

## Installation

### Base Requirements

1. **Requires yt-dlp `NIGHTLY 2024.09.13.232912` or above.**

2. If using Docker image for option (a) for the provider, the Docker runtime is required.  
   Otherwise, Node.js (>= 18) and Yarn are required. You will also need to clone the repository.

### 1. Set up the provider

There are two options for the provider, an always running POT generation HTTP server, and a POT generation script invoked when needed. The HTTP server option is simpler, and comes with a prebuilt Docker image. **You only need to choose one option.**

#### (a) HTTP Server Option

The provider is a Node.js HTTP server. You have two options of running it: as a prebuilt docker image, or manually as a node application.

**Docker:**

```shell
docker run --name bgutil-provider -d -p 4416:4416 brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

**Native:**

```shell
# replace 0.6.0 with the latest version, or a matching plugin
git clone --single-branch --branch 0.6.0 https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.git
cd bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
npx tsc
node build/main.js
```

<details>
  <summary>Server Endpoints/Environment Variables</summary>

**Environment Variables**

- **TOKEN_TTL**: The time in hours for a PO token to be considered valid. While there are no definitive answers on how long a token is valid, it has been observed to be valid for atleast a couple of days. Default: 6

**Endpoints**

- **POST /get_pot**: Accepts a `visitor_data` (unauthenticated), `data_sync_id` (authenticated) or an empty body in the request body. If no identifier is passed, a new unauthenticated `visitor_data` will be generated. Returns `po_token` and the associated identifier `visit_identifier`.
- **POST /invalidate_caches**: Resets the PO token cache, forcing new tokens to be generated on next fetch.

#### (b) Generation Script Option

1. Transpile the generation script to Javascript:

```shell
# Clone/extract the contents into your home directory (`~/` on Unix-based systems, `%USERPROFILE%` for Windows)
# if you want to use this method without needing to specify `getpot_bgutil_script` extractor argument on each yt-dlp invocation.
cd ~
# replace 0.6.0 with the latest version, or a matching plugin
git clone --single-branch --branch 0.6.0 https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider.git
cd bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
npx tsc
```

2. Make sure `node` is available in your `PATH`.

### 2. Install the plugin

#### PyPI:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -U bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider
```

This will automatically install [coletdjnz's POT plugin framework](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-get-pot) if haven't installed it yet.

#### Manual:

1. Make sure you have [coletdjnz's POT plugin framework](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-get-pot) installed already (must be at least version 0.1.1 or newer).
2. Download the latest release zip from [releases](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/releases). Install it by placing the zip into one of the [plugin folders](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installing-plugins).

## Usage

If using option (a) HTTP Server for the provider, and the default IP/port number, you can use yt-dlp like normal ðŸ™‚.

If you want to change the port number used by the provider server, use the `--port` option.

```shell
node build/main.js --port 8080
```

If changing the port or IP used for the provider server, pass it to yt-dlp via `getpot_bgutil_baseurl`

```shell
--extractor-args "youtube:getpot_bgutil_baseurl=http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

---

If using option (b) script for the provider, with the default script location in your home directory (i.e: `~/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`), you can also use yt-dlp like normal.

If you installed the script in a different location, pass it as the extractor argument `getpot_bgutil_script` to `youtube` for each yt-dlp call.

```shell
--extractor-args "youtube:getpot_bgutil_script=$WORKSPACE/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider/server/build/generate_once.js"
```

---

If both methods are available for use, the option (b) script will be prioritized.
